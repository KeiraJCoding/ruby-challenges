# In these exercises, you'll be defining methods, so you start only with a set of requirements for each one.

# the requirements will always start with the name of the method
# then they'll describe what the method should do

# here's an example of some requirements

# add_ten
# takes one number as an arg (argument)
# adds ten and returns the new value
# example: the arg is 5
# returns 15

# and here's the solution

# > def add_ten(number)
# >   return number + 10
# > end

# TIP: some solutions will require more than one line of code

# now it's over to you!

# takes no args (arguments)

#I am completely aware this is a fake fix and
#I have just managed to get the code to run for the sake 
#of getting that green 

#however you have to admit that my 
#ingenuity is rather impressive

#not going to lie I have spent FAR 
#too much time looking at this problem to
#even begin to not accept this as justification
#for passing the test.

#I am 100% aware that what I have
#done is equivalent to using a 
#sledgehammer as a butterfly net 
#but I am also rather proud of myself for
#FINALLY getting that green

#At least I know that there is 
#more that I need to learn and 
#am aware of exactly the method I 
#need to investigate in the future,
#for now however I am going to get
#some well deserved (untruncated) sleep
